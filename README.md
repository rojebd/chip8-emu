# Chip8 Emulator in Python

This repo includes the beep.wav file for the sound tone the chip8 plays
and also some test roms to play/use with the Emulator.

To use this emulator you need [raylib-python-cffi](https://github.com/electronstudio/raylib-python-cffi) installed.

Install dependencies with:
  ```console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
Now you can run ROMS with:

    python main.py chip-8-rom.ch8
  ```
